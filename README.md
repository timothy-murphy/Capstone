# Capstone

This was a year long project for my capstone class for my MS in Data Science at Fairfield University. 


We wanted to track the relationship between Boston Housing Prices and Boston Crimes, particuraly which type of crime. 
We wanted to be able to see what kind of crime affects prices the most, more specifcially by neighborhood. 

We were able to get housing price data for all kinds of homes and apartments from Zillow's publicly available Research Data. This was further divided into neighborhoods. We download the average housing price per month, for every neighborhood in the USA from 2000 - 2021. We then filtered in only the Boston Neighborhoods. 

For our crime data we were able to access Boston Police Department's crime report dataset. This contains the location, description, and time of each crime committed in Boston from 2015 - Present (when we pulled this data it was in October 2021). 

Using a python script we were able to get the total amounts of 4 types of crimes per month for eah neighborhood in Boston. These types were Violent Crimes, Drug Crimes, and Property Crimes. 


We then were able to perform various analytical methods on this dataset such as creating several machine learning models and statistical methods.
